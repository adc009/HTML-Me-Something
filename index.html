                     I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 2019 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've always loved using technology and designing new ideas, 
                     and the combination of creativity, resourcefulness, and practical application was what drew me to this area of study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     This was also influenced by my role on my high school robotics team, where I was a lead builder. I loved the process of taking something from an idea to a design, then
                     using that design to create a solution to a problem, and I wanted to pursue a career in which I can take part in this process.

                     As a student, I worked part-time on the Washington University Shared IT Services team, which was working on a massive project to migrate all of the computers
                     on campus to a new network infrastructure. On this team, I routinely processed thousands of data points on networks, users, and application usage
                     to identify the next steps for successful completion of the project. While doing this, I was able to teach myself how to use VBA to program macros for Microsoft Excel. For example,
                     I was tasked with taking data from large numbers of separate files and consolidating them into one file. I was able to create a script to automate the process of opening every spreadsheet
                     in a specified directory, copying the data, and appending it into an output spreadsheet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     After graduating, I worked at a machine shop in St. Charles where I processed engineering documents to develop estimates for how much it would cost 
                     to manufacture parts. Over time I found myself gravitating towards working with data, and this led me to pursue an opportunity as a data analyst.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In this new role, I learned to code large and complex queries in SQL to pull data based on user requests. I really found myself enjoying
                     the coding aspect of this role. I love the logic and problem solving it involves!

                     or something similar. This web page is for an assignment, where I am making a re&#769sume&#769 of sorts using HTML5 and CSS.
